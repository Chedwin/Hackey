Introduction:
This is my first ever game engine. It is mainly focused on building 3rd person platformer-like games.
Hurricane is programmed purely in C++ to allow for fast memory management and efficiency.

Dependencies:
Hurricane makes use of many different 3rd party APIs to allow for ease of use, production time reduction, etc.
I do not own any of the APIs listed below and all rights and credits belong to their repsective owners.
